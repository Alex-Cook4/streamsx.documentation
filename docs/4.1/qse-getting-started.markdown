#  Getting Started with Streams

## Introduction to the Streams Quick Start Edition VMware

The Streams Quick Start Editor VMware can help you get started with Streams quickly, without having to install a Streams cluster environment. These images are available [here](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/stream-computing/).

### Getting Started with the Image Desktop

The following shortcuts are available on the image desktop to help you get started: 

* **Streams Domain Manager** - The Domain Manager is an application for managing your Streams domain.  With the domain manager, you can create, start, stop, or delete a domain.  You may also edit the various properties from a Streams domain.  The images are set up with Streams domain by default:  *StreamsDomain*.  
* **Streams Studio** - Streams Studio is the integrated development environment for developing your Streams application.  
* **Streams Console** - Streams Console is the web-based administrative tool for all your Streams administration and management needs.  You may use the Streams Console to monitor the health of your Streams environment.  You may also manage and modify various properties and security settings from the console.

### Streams Community
The following Streams resources can help you connect with the Streams community and get support when you need it:

* **[StreamsDev](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/)** - This resource is a developer-to-developer website maintained by the Streams Development Team.  It contains many useful articles and getting started material.  Check back often for new articles, tips and tricks to this website.
* **[Streams Forum](https://www.ibmdw.net/answers/questions/?community=streamsdev&sort=newest&refine=none)** - This forum enables you to ask and answer questions that relate to InfoSphere Streams. If you have questions, start here.
* **[IBMStreams on Github](http://ibmstreams.github.io)** - Streams is shipped with many useful toolkits out of the box.  IBMStreams on Github  contains many open-source toolkits.  For a list of available toolkits available on Github, see this web page:  [IBMStreams Github Toolkits](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/github-projects-overview/).
* **[IBM Streams Support](http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/Overview/Software/Information_Management/InfoSphere_Streams)** - This website provides information about InfoSphere Streams downloads, technical support tools, documentation, and other resources.
* **[IBM Streams Product Site](http://www.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/streams)** - This website provides a broad range of information and resources about Streams and related topics.
